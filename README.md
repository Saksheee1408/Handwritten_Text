‚úçÔ∏è Handwritten Text Recognition (OCR) System
üìå Overview

This project focuses on identifying and extracting text from handwritten images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) powered by deep learning. The goal is to convert scanned notes, forms, and handwritten documents into machine-readable and searchable text with high accuracy.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries / Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR

Preprocessing: NumPy, Pillow, Scikit-image

Frontend (optional): Streamlit / React for UI

Database (optional): PostgreSQL / MongoDB for storing recognized text and metadata

üöÄ Features

Upload or capture handwritten document images.

Preprocess images: grayscale, noise removal, binarization, and contour detection.

Extract and segment handwritten regions using OpenCV.

Use a CNN-RNN model (or pretrained Tesseract) to recognize text lines and words.

Display recognized text on the interface and export as .txt or .pdf.

Supports multilingual recognition (extendable with fine-tuning).
